      <h1>Dear friends and family</h1>
      <p>
        We're delighted that you've received our invitation, and found your way here!
      </p>
      <p>
        We are very much looking forward to celebrating our wedding with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the lockdown is much less restrictive when it comes to private gatherings,
        we've decided to host our wedding celebration at Carolines's parents'
        countryside estate - on Eker√∂ island outside of Stockholm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, fingers crossed that the restrictions let up - or at the
        very least, remain the same. Nevertheless, we'll be outside the whole
        day, and the bride and groom will do their utmost to get vaccinated in
        anticipation of the event. The plan from the swedish government is that
        everyone will be given the possibility to get vaccinated well before our
        date! ü§ó
      </p>
      <p>
        If we are forced to cancel the event, we will reach out to everybody
        that RSVP:ed and update the website.
      </p>

      <h1>Info about the day</h1>
      <p>
        We will start the day with some bubbly and mingling, after which there
        will be a short ceremony. During the rest of the day, we'll get to know
        each other by playing games, quizzes, after which we'll sit down for
        dinner together.
      </p>
      <p>
        After dinner is over, the party will start. Our friends will DJ, you'll
        get to dance, hang out in the bar, or deep-talk in one of the lounge
        areas. Very much, choose your experience.
      </p>

      <h1>Lodging and transportation</h1>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the island does not have much to offer in terms of
        hotels, but is well connected by both roads and communal transport.
        When it comes to transport and living arrangements, we are recommending
        three options:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Living in Stockholm
          <p>
            A bus is available to take you from the city center. The bus
            leaves from the central station's bus terminal, "Cityterminalen".
            The bus is scheduled to leave at 12:30 from the city, and a return
            bus is available at 1 AM from the party.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Camping on the grounds
          <p>
            For those of you who wish to stay over with us out on the estate, we
            will be pitching two military tents with heaters housing 20 persons
            each. You're welcome to stay both the day before, and the day
            after. You'll be able to access the showers and bathrooms of the
            estate. First come, first serve! This option is available in the
            RSVP.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          AirBnB
          <p>
            Further down on the Island there are quite a few AirBnB, but since it's
            a bit further away - we recommend driving or pre-booking a cab. We can
            help you out with the latter if you let us know.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h1 id="toasts">Toast masters & speeches!</h1>
      <p>
        It's swedish tradition to have toast masters for weddings. Our toast
        masters for the evening are Malin Ekman and Pontus Lundmark. If you
        wish to share a fond memory of us or give a short speech, please let
        our toast masters know at
        <a href="mailto:mulderwitasp2021@gmail.com">mulderwitasp2021@gmail.com</a> ü§ó

      <h1>F√∂rfest och √ñppen-g√•rd fredag 6e kl 16-23!</h1>
      <p>
        Vi vill ju g√§rna erbjuda samma m√∂jligheter till f√∂rk√∂r kv√§llen innan dagen D
        som om vi hade varit i Sk√•ne, s√• f√∂r de som vill kommer det att grillas korv
        och drickas b√§rs p√• g√•rden kv√§llen innan! Det kommer √§ven att vara √∂ppet f√∂r en
        st√∂rre skara familjev√§nner, s√• vi blir ett stort g√§ng! Kom och spela krocket,
        kubb, och bara h√§ng!
      </p>
      -->

      <h1>Gifts</h1>
      <p>
        We have more than enough wordly possesions! Your presence is your gift
        to us.
      </p>

      <h1>What's the ceremony?</h1>
      <p>
        Since we really want to get married with 100% certainty, we'll do so
        legally before our closest family before the wedding. This ceremony will
        thus be symbolic and short - giving us more time to focus on the party ü•≥
      </p>

      <h1>Dresscode</h1>
      <p>
        Smart casual with a dash of summer! We do want to press that we'll be in
        the countryside. This means we'll mostly be on grass or gravel. So choose
        an attire that you're comfortable in!
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the evenings do get chilly, so bring a sweater!
      </p>
